                            This baby therapist (as in newly practicing, not therapist for babies) and feline enthusiast is a big fan of
                            feelings, rollerblading and peanut butter. And she loves Austin like a diabetic loves insulin. See what we
                            did there? ;)

					<div>   Like most great love stories, ours begins with a theme party and online dating. Cassady’s friend Andrea (aka the Maid of Honor) was tired of hearing horror stories about guys from bars, so she set up an online profile for Cassady without her knowledge. Upon finding out, Cassady cursed Andrea’s first born and drove straight over to punch her in the teeth, only to spend the next 3 hours ogling shirtless men in fedoras. And then, Cassady received this message:<br><br>

							<i>It's funny you put marriage therapy and working towards world peace in the same sentence. I think that if everyone were in a healthy relationship there would be a lot less people out there trying to start wars.</i><br><br>

							<i>Anyways, you said you like theme parties, and my friend is throwing a great one this Saturday for her 30th birthday. It's a 50 Shades of Grey theme. If that's not too intimidating I'd be happy to invite you.</i><br><br>

							He didn’t have to wait long for a response:<br><br>
							<i>Hi Austin, I'm Cassady. I don't do a whole lot of marriage counseling, but I have a feeling if Fidel Castro had had a healthy relationship with a good woman, we'd all still be smoking Cubans right now. Maybe that whole missile crisis thing could have been avoided all together.</i><br><br>

							<i>As for this party you speak of--if by your "friend" you mean you and by "throwing a great party for her 30th birthday" you mean lurking around someone else's house clutching a blindfold and a role of duct tape, well, at least it would make for an interesting first date story. That being said, I'm not going to pretend that I'm not intrigued by your offer…</i><br><br>

							Cassady received Austin’s reply the next day:<br><br>
							<i>I can see the headlines now:</i><br><br>

							<i>In a surprising move, on the first day of the 2013 World Peace Summit world leaders were instructed to pair off with their significant others and a licensed therapist so they could engage in behavioral couples therapy and situational role play exercises. The day ended abruptly following these sessions when all of the couples retired to their rooms and were not seen until morning. While interactions between leaders at the start of the summit were tense and argumentative, by the second day the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and there were a surprising number of winks and high-fives observed. When asked to comment President Obama was quoted as saying "Now that Michelle and I have learned to be happy together I don't feel like I need to prove myself to her anymore, so I'm pulling the troops out of Afghanistan and bringing them home." In a speech following the summit Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said "After learning that my wife loves me for who I am, I came to realize that my attempts to develop nuclear weapons were simply me overcompensating for my own perceived inadequacy. Our nuclear weapons program will be terminated immediately." For his role in masterminding the summit, Dr. Phil has been nominated for the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize.</i><br><br>

							<i>Unfortunately my friend really does exist, so we'll have to find another way to make for an interesting first date story. She's renting the Red Velvet Room at Rendezvous, so we'll have our own private area but we can also go down to the main area if we want. And don't worry it's all normal people, I don't want you thinking that you're showing up to some kind of swingers party.</i><br><br>

							<i>Let me know what you think, I promise you'll at least get an interesting first date story out of it.</i><br><br>

							Cassady was quick to answer:<br><br>
							<i>So I cut and pasted your headline paragraph above onto my cohort's fb page and you were very well received. In fact, two very attractive (albeit taken--sorry!) ladies have "liked" your "article" lol.</i><br><br>


							<i>I do have to warn you I might not be able to make it because I haven't been feeling well and I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. I don't want to smoosh your chances to seduce another young lady so if there's someone else you'd like to invite, that's totally cool. I'd hate for you to be forced to waste such a golden opportunity!</i><br><br>

							Austin’s response was perfect:<br><br>
							<i>Well, I guess it's a good thing that a third attractive and available lady also liked the article ;). I think I'm willing to take my chances and hope that you're feeling better by Saturday. I'm sure I'll have fun there even if you can't make it, but it'll be a lot more fun if you can.</i><br><br>

							A few Sounders’ games, Jung’s theory on synchronicity, a considerable number of hours binge watching “Iron Chef” on Netflix and a cat stroller later, we arrived in Hawaii where Austin proposed. Cassady immediately said yes!</p>

						<h5>Nathan Stickney</h5>
						<h6>Best Man</h6>
						<p>
                            From the very beginning, Austin and Nathan were as close as two brothers can be expected to be. Their childhood was
                            filled with epic indoor soccer matches in the basement (along with a number of holes in the walls) and thousands
                            of hours of Zelda, Rygar and Baseball Simulator 3000 on the Nintendo. They stayed great friends as they got older,
                            living together multiple times. Considering all this, plus his clockwork reliability and almost obsessive desire to
                            be the center of attention, how could Austin not ask his little brother to be the best man at his wedding?
                        </p>

                            Washington on the first of a 3-day conference for AmeriCorps volunteers.
                            If you read Cassady and Austin’s story, you’ll know that it was Andrea who
                            created Cassady’s online dating profile that will culminate into this awesome
                            wedding you’ll be going to. Even though Andrea is now a kick-ass lawyer in New York,
                            distance can’t keep these two from staying close.</p>

						<p>
                            Austin and Jack met when they were all of 6 months old and it was instantly clear that they would be
                            partners in crime for life. Whether it was ... when they were ..., or nearly burning down the forest in
                            Austin's parents' backyard when they were clearly old enough to know better, they have always found a way to
                            tempt fate and walk away mostly unharmed (Austin still has a scar from that car accident).

                            longest—and has by far paid the most dues. Despite being 7 years her senior, Karen
                            was sent to bed early with Cassady at family gatherings. (And then Cassady threw
                            up on her as they slept and didn’t tell her.) Now that they both live in Seattle and
                            behave like adults (mostly), they are great friends and share a mutual love of all
                            things dairy.</p>

						<h5>Brendan Berch</h5>
						<h6>Groomsman</h6>
						<p>
                            Brendan and Austin were thrown together as pledges at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and they became friends amidst
                            a quarter long series of cruel and unusual hazing rituals. They would later, along with Skip and some others, lay claim to
                            the entire third floor of the house, turning it into a non-stop party zone, and paying back the upperclassmen who had hazed them
                            by blaring techno music until 4:00am. They remained good friends after college, living together once in a ugly ant infested
                            house in Lake City, and later in a beautiful yet cockroach infested house on the island of Kauai.

						<h5>Katie Reynolds</h5>
						<h6>Bridesmaid</h6>
						<p>Cassady and Katie met at Big Brothers Big Sisters and it is a damn miracle that they
                            became friends after Cassady inadvertently insulted Katie’s favorite Ninja Turtle.
                            After one particularly interesting interview together whereby such inside jokes as
                            “A dog would be lovely” were born, the two soon became good friends and went on
                            to terrorize frequenters of the George and Dragon pub and those residing in the
                            greater Fremont area via shopping cart.</p>

                        <p>
                            When Skip joined the fraternity as a new pledge it was clear that he was a prodigy when it came to partying.
                            In Skip’s own words, as Austin found him nearly unconscious after falling from their third floor window during
                            a party, “I’ll drink all of you under the table”. It was obvious that this would be a lasting friendship.
                            Unbeknownst to its significance at the time, Austin made a VIP trade circa 2005 whereby he lost Skip,
                            inventer of the No-Shirt Zone at the frat house, to San Diego and gained Cassady
                            (who, 10 years later, would go on to live with Austin and support similar Zone policies) when she moved up
                            here for undergrad.

                            for adorable things (people, cats, pictures of cats, etc). Austin loves squeezies, so we felt it was imperative to let you know
                            because if you see this process in action, you will wonder where the hell it came from.

                            Cassady and Michelle met in graduate school near the end of their partying days. One evening Cassady accidentally
                            left her phone in the bathroom of a seedy establishment. Being the brand new 4S, it was immediately snatched up
                            by some horrible person, but Michelle called that phone diligently, leaving several messages compelling the thief
                            to "be a good person" and return the stolen merchandise (just in case he or she decided to check my voicemail).
                            The phone was never located, but friendship was found! Now much too cool and mature (pronounced “mah-toor”) for
                            clubbing, you can often find them reading children’s books aloud to each other at Target and providing witty
                            commentary on the various outfits and walking styles at Greenlake.

                                DeLille has both a tasting room (where there will be no wedding) and a chateau (where there will be an AWESOME wedding). Although these two
                                locations are not far from each other, a mile may as well be 20 if you’re wearing high heels (or carrying a full-grown woman on your back) so

							We were surprised it was rated #5 of the 5 hotels.  This hotel is the only
							one that had 2 bedroom suites. This is the only one that has full kitchens. Outdoor pool.
							basketball and badminton court and a hiking trail. Free breakfast.  There was one review
							that complained they found mold in the air conditioner, but I trust that has been taken
							care of. This (4 of 5 stars) has a higher rating on Yelp than the next one (3 1/2 of 5
							stars):<br><br>

							I liked the looks of this place better (esp inside the units), but it costs more ($100 more
							than Country Inn). It is farther to walk to the pool which has a white fence all around it
							and the pool area is not as attractive as the other hotel;  (the pool was closed when I went
							there Oct 28, 2015).  But the rooms are all remodeled and look very nice. Some single
							bedrooms and some single rooms have king beds, more have queens. Has lovely kitchens,
							much more room, a sitting area with a sofa; more attractive rooms, and it's a bigger
							place.  The woman we met with said sometimes people can hear people walking above,
							could prefer upstairs for that, but with kids, downstairs might be easier.

							Although we have no official MOB review for this hotel, we can tell you that It. Is.
							Gorgeous. And a touch spendy. Next to the famous Chateau Saint Michelle and several
							other tasting rooms, Willows is less than a mile from Chateau DeLille. It features
							beautiful gardens and trails, a full-service spa and gourmet cuisine. They also provide
							complimentary “shuttle service” via Mercedes to guests of the hotel so if it helps to
							justify this beautiful, if not somewhat steep establishment as your choice, you can
							appreciate the fact that the cost of your DD is built into the price of the room.
